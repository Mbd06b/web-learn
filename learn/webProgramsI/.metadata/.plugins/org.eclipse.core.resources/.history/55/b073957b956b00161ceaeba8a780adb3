				<h2>Objective</h2>
				<p>Looking for an exciting career in nuclear physics.<br />
				I had a course in physics, and found it very exciting.<br />
				Just the thought of peering into the <b><i>eerie blue light</i></b><br />
				...well, you get the idea.</p>

				<h2>Education</h2>
				<p><b>Collin County Community College.</b><br />
				In addition to my physics course, I took a course in history called, <br />
				&quot;History of Strange Religions of the Western World.&quot;<br />
				Very exciting, but the professor didn't grade me fairly, so I got a C.</p>
				
				<p><b>University of North Texas.</b><br />
				Didn't exactly pass any of my classes, but I learned a lot. </p>
