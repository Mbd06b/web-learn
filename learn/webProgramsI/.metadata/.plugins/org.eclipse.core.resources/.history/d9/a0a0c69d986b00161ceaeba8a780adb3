				<h2>Objective</h2>
				<p>Looking for an exciting career in nuclear physics.<br />
				I had a course in physics, and found it very exciting.<br />
				Just the thought of peering into the <span>eerie blue light</span><br />
				...well, you get the idea.</p>

				<h2>Education</h2>
				<p><b>Collin County Community College.</b><br />
				In addition to my physics course, I took a course in history called, <br />
				&quot;History of Strange Religions of the Western World.&quot;<br />
				Very exciting, but the professor didn't grade me fairly, so <span>I got a C.</span></p>
				
				<p><b>University of North Texas.</b><br />
				Didn't exactly pass any of my classes, but I learned a lot. </p>

				<h3>Employment History</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>May 2011 - July 2011. Harold's Texaco.<br />
						Kept the bays spotless. Left because I was only being paid $6 per hour. 
					</li>
					<li>December 2010 - January 2011. Wal-Mart.<br />
						Unloaded Trucks. They fired me when I punched a customer, but she deserved it.<br />
						This was just a Christmas job.
					</li>
